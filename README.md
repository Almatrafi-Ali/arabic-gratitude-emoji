## 🌍 Cultural Context

This gesture is widely recognized across Arab cultures and increasingly used worldwide to express deep emotional gratitude. It gained viral traction after a public moment featuring Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and was later adopted by media presenters, humanitarian workers, and children.

It visually and emotionally fills a gap in current emoji options by representing a respectful and universal expression of sincere appreciation.
